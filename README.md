# Splash Screen Repro app

This was created with `npx create-expo ./example-splash-screen --example with-splash-screen`, that didn't seem to use the new expo 52 stuff whatsoever! So I've completely changed everything to match the example here: 

https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/splash-screen/#usage

Standalone android app is built with `eas build -p android --profile preview`.
